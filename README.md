# 📚 Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal **Knowledge Base** — a curated collection of notes, concepts, and explanations that I use to learn, revise, and share important topics in software engineering, system design, and computer science.

This repository is not meant to be a tutorial or a course, but rather a **well-organized set of concise, practical notes** that focus on clarity, real-world understanding, and quick revision.
